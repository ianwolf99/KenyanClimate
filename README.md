# KenyanClimate
There's has been serious climatic change in Kenya.The python scripts address this issue

To track desertification and visualize data in Kenya, you can follow these general steps:

Obtain satellite imagery data for the desired region in Kenya. This can be done through various sources, such as NASA's Earth Observations (https://neo.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/) or the US Geological Survey's EarthExplorer (https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/). Make sure to select data in the appropriate format for your analysis, such as GeoTIFF.

Preprocess the satellite imagery data to remove any noise or irrelevant information. This can be done using various image processing techniques in Python, such as thresholding, filtering, and segmentation.

Use machine learning or computer vision algorithms to analyze the preprocessed satellite imagery data and identify areas of desertification. This may involve training a model to recognize certain patterns or features associated with desertification, such as changes in vegetation cover or soil color.

Visualize the results of your analysis using various charts, maps, and graphs in Python. This can be done using libraries such as matplotlib, seaborn, and folium.

Obtain satellite imagery: You can get satellite imagery from various sources such as NASA or Google Earth Engine.

Preprocessing the satellite imagery: This step involves preprocessing the satellite imagery to remove any noise or distortions. You can use image processing libraries such as OpenCV or Scikit-image for this step.

Segment the image: Segmenting the image involves dividing it into regions or objects of interest. You can use algorithms such as watershed segmentation, k-means clustering or deep learning-based segmentation to segment the image.

Identify vegetation: Desertification leads to the loss of vegetation cover. You can use image processing techniques such as thresholding, color-based segmentation or machine learning-based classification to identify areas with vegetation.

Calculate vegetation indices: Vegetation indices such as NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) and EVI (Enhanced Vegetation Index) can help you to assess vegetation cover and track changes over time. You can calculate these indices using Python libraries such as Rasterio, NumPy, and Matplotlib.

Classify the land: You can use machine learning-based classification algorithms such as Random Forest or Support Vector Machine (SVM) to classify the land into different categories such as barren land, vegetated land, and water bodies.

Visualize the data: You can use Python libraries such as Matplotlib, Seaborn, or Plotly to visualize the processed data in the form of graphs, maps, or interactive visualizations.

Here is a sample code snippet that shows how to calculate NDVI
