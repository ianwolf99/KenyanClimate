# KenyanClimate
There's has been serious climatic change in Kenya.The python scripts address this issue

To track desertification and visualize data in Kenya, you can follow these general steps:

Obtain satellite imagery data for the desired region in Kenya. This can be done through various sources, such as NASA's Earth Observations (https://neo.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/) or the US Geological Survey's EarthExplorer (https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/). Make sure to select data in the appropriate format for your analysis, such as GeoTIFF.

Preprocess the satellite imagery data to remove any noise or irrelevant information. This can be done using various image processing techniques in Python, such as thresholding, filtering, and segmentation.

Use machine learning or computer vision algorithms to analyze the preprocessed satellite imagery data and identify areas of desertification. This may involve training a model to recognize certain patterns or features associated with desertification, such as changes in vegetation cover or soil color.

Visualize the results of your analysis using various charts, maps, and graphs in Python. This can be done using libraries such as matplotlib, seaborn, and folium.
